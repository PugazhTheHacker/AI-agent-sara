#🤖 AI-Agent-Sara — Gemini Powered Telegram Bot

AI-Agent-Sara is an intelligent Telegram chatbot built with Python.
It connects Google Gemini AI API with the Telegram Bot API, letting you chat with a powerful AI directly inside Telegram — like having your own personal AI assistant on your phone.

#🌟 Features

✅ Chat with Google’s Gemini AI directly in Telegram
✅ Fully written in Python using only requests
✅ Works on Linux, Windows, or cloud hosting (Render, Replit, VPS)
✅ Secure with environment variables (no hard-coded keys)
✅ Easy to extend for tools like nmap, weather, or news

#🧠 How It Works

Telegram Bot receives your message using Telegram Bot API.
The Python program forwards that message text to Gemini AI API.
Gemini processes the text using its large language model (LLM).

BOT_TOKEN = your_telegram_bot_token
